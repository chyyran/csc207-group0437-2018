# Eric Lindau
    - Everything under "remoting" package/directory (client/server packages, DataListener/Manager,
      ... DataService)
    - RMI backend that links with separate database backend and allows for connection of remote
      ... clients that all synchronize their UIs to represent the same remote data model and can
      ... interact with each other over the network
    - Fixed bugs with every UI controller, ensuring that null checks are performed and logical
      ... errors are less frequent
    - Fixed issues with FXML files and enhanced the performance/look of UI
    - Refactored UI components, improved efficiency of data logic checks
